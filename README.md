Yesterday I was reading a collection of poems by Sylvia Plath titled _Ariel_. Her poetry is full of complications of diction and tone that create **masterpieces** of the English language.\
One of my favorite examples is her poem titled "Two Sisters of Persephone":\\
>Two girls there are : within the house\
>One sits; the other, without.\
>Daylong a duet of shade and light\
>Plays between these. \

>In her dark wainscoted room\
>The first works problems on\
>A mathematical machine.\
>Dry ticks mark time \

>As she calculates each sum.\
>At this barren enterprise\
>Rat-shrewd go her squint eyes,\
>Root-pale her meager frame. \

>Bronzed as earth, the second lies,\
>Hearing ticks blown gold\
>Like pollen on bright air. Lulled\
>Near a bed of poppies, \

>She sees how their red silk flare\
>Of petaled blood\
>Burns open to the sun's blade.\
>On that green alter \

>Freely become sun's bride, the latter\
>Grows quick with seed.\
>Grass-couched in her labor's pride,\
>She bears a king. Turned bitter \

>And sallow as any lemon,\
>The other, wry virgin to the last,\
>Goes graveward with flesh laid waste,\
>Worm-husbanded, yet no woman.\
